# ExUnitSummary

The library was created as an extension for EÑ‡Unit and adds test case output, just like Rspec does.

It's a very convenient life cycle for fixing and adding tests is obtained.

The developer just needs to select any entry from the results, copy it and paste it again into the console

See the example below
